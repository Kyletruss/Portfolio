## SUPPLEMENTAL RESOURCES  
1.	PhoneLogs

> This project is a loose copy of a project that I developted for Dexian which I have submitted as my capstone for my Bachelors in Software Engineering at Western Governers University. The original project utilizes API's to query call data from the companies phone provider, Zoom, and stores it along with Zoom user data in a MySQL database to provide call log data to managers. The site is hosted on WordPress Engine. The PhoneLogs project that is included in this repository is an old copy of the company Zoom PhoneLogs project that has been stripped down of any business data. Instead of utilizing Zoom APIs to gather the data I built in an admin function that generates random calls over a period of time and stores them in a MySQL database. The user authentication has been cusom built and includes password hashing. Additionally, users can be assigned roles for various access levels, the role information is stored in JavaScript objects. The project is hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance running Linux OS and Apache on an to showcase my skills in AWS.
